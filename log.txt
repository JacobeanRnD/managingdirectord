Functionality

1. Model docker container lifecycle in SCXML. States, transitions and events. 
2. Include a circuit breaker for communicating with the SCXML container. 
3. Persist snapshot to database. 

Tests for Failure

1. Send event into container. Event times out. 
2. Container crash event; container restart.

Edge cases:

1. Use <script> for stateless init. 
2. 

Test crash behaviour somehow. Mock objects?
