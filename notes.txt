  Targetless transitions. Do not show as loops.
  <script> shows first line of js, plus ellipses if there is more than one line.
  Support for UML comments. Model as UML note with arrow transition pointing backward.
  Internal transitions.
  Auto-zoom to area that changed since last save. Animate color on entry.
  Hover over a transition to highlight it, source and target states - interactivity.
  Search inside visualization

Better tooling: show js errors.
